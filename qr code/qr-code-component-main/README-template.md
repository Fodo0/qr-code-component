## Overview
Basic HTML QR Code Project
Built using basic CSS

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- How to import google fonts
- How to use margins and padding
- How to use classes and ids
- Different units of CSS
- How to manage <div>
- How to round up corners 
- That I need to design a website with mobile design in mind first
- Creating variables

- Made the website responsive using the following, with the correct max-width %
body  {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}

@Media Query Is ESSENTIAL! For limiting the container
### Continued development
